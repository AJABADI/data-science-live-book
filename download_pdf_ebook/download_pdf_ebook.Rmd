# Download PDF and eBook

If you liked the book and wanted to support the project, you can acquire forever and ever the portable **Data Science Live Book version** in both formats, PDF, and eBook ðŸ™‚. 

<br> 

_Is there any difference between the on-line and the PDF/eBook version?_

No, they are the same. The Data Science Live Book is and will always be fully accessible, actually it's open source  (`Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International`).

* _What happen if a new version is released? / Can I access newer versions?_

When you get your first copy, you can download newer versions. You'll be notified via email.

_How can I contact you?_

If you want to say hello, contribute by telling that some part is not well explained, suggest a new topic or share some good experience you had applying any concept explained here, you are welcome to drop me an email at: pcasas.biz <at> gmail.com

Also, if now the economics times don't go so well and you _need_ the portable version anyway, just let me know.

I like the idea of having -when possible- free education material so anyone who wants to study and explore new horizons will do it.

With a minimum of **US$9** (US dollar), the modality is **name-your-price**, and also there is the option to pick up the quantity. Below the purchase button, you'll be redirected to a secure site.
