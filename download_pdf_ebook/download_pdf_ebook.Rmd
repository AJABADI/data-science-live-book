# Download PDF and eBook

If you liked the book and wanted to support the project, you can acquire forever and ever the portable **Data Science Live Book version** in both formats, PDF, and eBook `r emo::ji("slightly_smiling_face")`. 

<br> 

_Is there any difference between the on-line and the PDF/eBook version?_

No, they are the same. The Data Science Live Book is and will always be fully accessible, actually it's open source  (`Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International`).

* _What happen if a new version is released? / Can I access newer versions?_

After your purchase, you will be notified via email with a download link when new versions of the book are released! (You can opt-out of being notified).

_How can I contact you?_

If you wish to contact me you can do so at pcasas.biz-at-gmail.com, you don’t need an specific reason anything from suggesting a new topic to just sharing a good experience after applying concepts you learnt here are welcome!

`r emo::ji("worried")`: _I don’t have enough money to contribute, but I still *really* want the portable version._
No worries, we all have rough times, just contact me at pcasas.biz gmail.com `r emo::ji("wink")`.

I like the idea of having -when possible- free education material so anyone who wants to study and explore new horizons will do it.


The modality is name-your-price, with a minimum of 9 US dollar, after clicking the purchase button you’ll be redirect to a **secure site**.

Hope you enjoy it! `r emo::ji("rocket")`
