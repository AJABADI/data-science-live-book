Target Profiling with Histograms

```{r variable_importance2b,  fig.height=2, fig.width=4}
plotar(data=heart_disease, str_input="age", str_target="has_heart_disease", plot_type = "boxplot")
```

_Rhomboid near the mean line represents the **median**._

*When to use boxplots?*
When you need to analyze different percentiles across the classes to predict. Note this is a powerful technique since the bias produced due to outliers doesn't affect as much as it does to the mean.


### B.1) Boxplot: Good vs. Bad variable
plotar(data=heart_disease, str=c('max_heart_rate', 'resting_blood_pressure'),  str_target="has_heart_disease", plot_type = "boxplot")

`max_heart_rate` is clearly a better predictor than `resting_blood_pressure`.

As a general rule, a variable will rank as **more important** if boxplots are **not aligned** horizontally.

_Statistical tests: percentiles are another used feature used by them in order to determine -for example- if means across groups are or not the same._

### Exporting plots
`plotar` and `cross_plot` can handle from 1 to N input variables, and plots generated by them can be easily exported in high quality with parameter `path_out`.
```{r variable_importance_2c, results="hide", fig.height=2, fig.width=4, eval=F}
plotar(data=heart_disease, str=c('max_heart_rate', 'resting_blood_pressure'),  str_target="has_heart_disease", plot_type = "boxplot", path_out = "my_awsome_folder")
```
