Predicting Heart Disease with Decision Trees
=====

### What is this about?

This case study covers the creation of a predictive model in which, based on patients clinical trials, we'll create  predict if the patient is likely to have a heart disease.


With the help of R you’ll get complex easy-to-read insights based on clinical trials. Hopefully this technology will be available to help everyone. 



From this point, you’ll also know what are the most important variables, and what values they must take in order to increase heart disease likelihood.


```{r ,results="hide", echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_knit$set(base.dir = "case_study_1_decision_trees")
```


```{r lib, results="hide"}
## Loading funModeling !
suppressMessages(library(funModeling))
data(heart_disease)
```

```{r}
correlation_table(data=heart_disease, str_target="has_heart_disease")
```

`R statistic` goes from `1` _positive correlation_ to `-1` _negative correlation_. A value around `0` implies no correlation.
Squaring this number returns the `R squared` statistic (aka `R2`), which goes from `0` _no correlation_ to `1` _high correlation_. 

### R2 bias problem

**R statistic is highly influenced by outliers and non-linear relationships.**

Outliers can be treated with `prep_outliers` function, present in this package.

Take a look at the **Anscombe's quartet**. These 4 relationships are quite different, but all of them have the same R2: 0.816.


```{r, out.width = 400, fig.retina = NULL, echo=F}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("anscombe_quartet.png")
```
