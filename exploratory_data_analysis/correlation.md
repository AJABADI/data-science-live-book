Correlation and Relationship
=====

### What is this about?

This chapter contains both methodological and practical aspects of measuring correlation in variables. We will see that _correlation_ word can be translated into "**functional relationship**".

In methodological you will find the Anscombe Quartet, a set of four plots with dissimilar spatial distribution, but sharing the same correlation measure. We'll go one step ahead re-calculating their relationship though a more robust metric (MIC).

We will mention **Information Theory** several times, although by now it's not going to be covered at the mathematical level, it's planned to. Many algorithms are based on it, even deep learning.

Understanding these concepts in low dimension (two variables) and small data (a bunch of rows) allow us to better understand high dimensional data. Nonetheless, some real cases are only _small_ data.

From the practical point of view, you'll be able to replicate the analysis with your own data, profiling and exposing their relationships in fancy plots.
