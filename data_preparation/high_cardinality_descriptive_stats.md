High Cardinality Variable
===

### What is this about?

A **high cardinality** variable is one in which it can take _many_ different values. For example country. 

This chapter will cover some implications of not treating, and possible methods to deal with them.

### High Cardinality in Descriptive Statistics

Following example contains a survey of 1000 cases, with 2 columns: `country` and `flu`, indicating the having of such ilness in last month.


```r
library(funModeling) 
```

`data_country` data comes inside `funModeling` package (please update to release 1.6).

Quick `data_country` profiling (first 10 rows)


```r
# plotting first 10 rows
head(data_country, 10)
```

```
##     person     country has_flu
## 478    478      France      no
## 990    990      Brazil      no
## 606    606      France      no
## 575    575 Philippines      no
## 806    806      France      no
## 232    232      France      no
## 422    422      Poland      no
## 347    347     Romania      no
## 858    858     Finland      no
## 704    704      France      no
```

```r
# exploring data, displaying only first 10 rows
head(freq(data_country, "country"), 10)
```

##           country frequency percentage cumulative_perc
## 1          France       288      31.65           31.65
## 2          Turkey        67       7.36           39.01
## 3           China        65       7.14           46.15
## 4         Uruguay        63       6.92           53.07
## 5  United Kingdom        45       4.95           58.02
## 6       Australia        41       4.51           62.53
## 7         Germany        30       3.30           65.83
## 8          Canada        19       2.09           67.92
## 9     Netherlands        19       2.09           70.01
## 10          Japan        18       1.98           71.99
```


```r
# exploring data
freq(data_country, "has_flu")
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4](figure/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

```
##   has_flu frequency percentage cumulative_perc
## 1      no       827      90.88           90.88
## 2     yes        83       9.12          100.00
```

Last table shows there are **70 different countries**, and ~9% of people who had flu -`has_flu="yes"`.

But many of them has almost have no participation in the data. This is the _long tail_, so one technique to reduce cardinality is to keep with those categories that are present the a high percentahge of data share, for example 70, 80 or 90%, the Paretto rule.


```r
# 'freq' function, from 'funModeling' package, retrieves the cumulative_percentage that will help to do the cut. 
country_freq=freq(data_country, 'country', plot = F)

# Since 'country_freq' is an ordered table by frequency, let's inspect the first 10 rows with the most share.
country_freq[1:10,]
```

```
##           country frequency percentage cumulative_perc
## 1          France       288      31.65           31.65
## 2          Turkey        67       7.36           39.01
## 3           China        65       7.14           46.15
## 4         Uruguay        63       6.92           53.07
## 5  United Kingdom        45       4.95           58.02
## 6       Australia        41       4.51           62.53
## 7         Germany        30       3.30           65.83
## 8          Canada        19       2.09           67.92
## 9     Netherlands        19       2.09           70.01
## 10          Japan        18       1.98           71.99
```


So 10 countries represent more the 70% of cases. We can assign the category `other` to remaining cases and plot:


```r
data_country$country_2=ifelse(data_country$country %in% country_freq[1:10,'country'], data_country$country, 'other')
freq(data_country, 'country_2')
```

##         country_2 frequency percentage cumulative_perc

## 2           other       255      28.02           59.67
## 3          Turkey        67       7.36           67.03
## 4           China        65       7.14           74.17

## 8         Germany        30       3.30           93.85
## 9          Canada        19       2.09           95.94
## 10    Netherlands        19       2.09           98.03
## 11          Japan        18       1.98          100.00
```

### Final comments

Low representative categories are sometimes errors in data, such as having: `Egypt`, `Eggypt.`, and may give some evidence in bad habbits collecting data and/or possible errors when collecting from the source.

There is no general rule, just to shrink data, it depends on each case.
