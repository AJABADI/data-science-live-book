### The intuition behind

Events can occur, or not... altough we don't have _tomorrow's newspaper_, we can make a good guess about how is it going to be.

The future is undoublty attached to *uncertanty*, and this uncertanty can be estimated.

### And there are diferents targets...

By now this book will cover the classical: Yes/No target -also known as binary or multiclass prediction.

So, this estimation is the _value of truth_ of an event to happen, therefore a probabilist value between 0 and 1.

### Hey what? 

Some examples:
- Is this client going to buy this product?
- Is this patient going to get better?
- Is certain event going to happen in the next weeks? 

The answers to last questions are True or False, but **the essense is to have an score**, or a number indicating the likelihood of certain event to happen.

### But we need more control...

Many machine learning resources shows the simplified version -wich is good to start- getting the final class as an output. Let's say:

Simplified approach:

* Question: _Is this person going to have a heart disease?_ 
* Answer: "No"

But there is the need of having more control over 

Complete approach: 

* Question: _What is the likelihood for this person of having heart disease?_
* Answer: "25%"







Beyond the fancy definition... the escence in this kind of projects is to get the score, rather than






There are events in opposition in the world, like going / going down, buy/not buy, to do certain thing or not. These will be facts, (no entropy) after they occured, we don't know with certanty if 


It's an estimation of the probability of ceratin event to occur -_i.e. having  heart disease_-, commongly in the range of [0 to 1]. 


### What is this about?

This case study covers the creation of a predictive model, based on patients clinical trials, that predicts the likelihood of having heart disease.



This project will achieve two goals, but others can need only one of them.

* A) *Scoring*: Create an score that measures heart disease likelihood, and
* B) *Descriptive*: Extract the rules (IF-THEN) that lead to a high/low score.



_Going deeply..._

A) *Scoring:* This part is the common used when a model has to be built and running in a real environment. Once an stable model is found, it may classify new cases.

B) *Descriptive*: Extracting rules is a more descriptive job, it will show the IF-THEN rules that gover the data. It exposes the inner structure of the information, allowing us to get new insights about how data is related.


From this point, you’ll also know what are the most important variables, and what values they must take in order to increase heart disease likelihood.


With the help of R you’ll get complex easy-to-read insights based on clinical trials. Hopefully this technology will be available to help everyone.
