# Selecting Best Variables

## What is this about?

This chapter will cover three types of plots which aim to understand what are the most correlated numeric variables against a target variable:


```{r ,results="hide", echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
#opts_knit$set(base.dir = "selecting_best_variables")
```

* **Overview**:
    + **Analysis purpose**: To identify if the input variable is a good/bad predictor through visual analysis. 
    + **General purpose**: To explain the decision of including -or not- a variable to a model to a *non-analyst* person.
