Profiling Target with Density Histograms
===

### What is this about?

Density histograms are quite standard in any book/resource when plotting distributions. To use them in selecting variables gives a quick view on how well certain variable separates the class.



```r
## Loading funModeling !
library(funModeling)
data(heart_disease)
```



```r
plotar(data=heart_disease, str_input="age", str_target="has_heart_disease", plot_type = "histdens")
```

_Dashed-line represents variable mean._

**Density histograms** are helpful to visualize the general shape of a numeric distribution.

This *general shape* is calculated based on a technique called **Kernel Smoother**, its general idea is to reduce high/low peaks (noise) present in near points/bars by estimating the function that describes the points. Here some pictures to illustrate the concept: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_smoother

#### Relationship with statistical test

Something similar is what a **statistical test** sees: they measured **how different** the curves are reflecting it in some statistics like the p-value using in the frequentist approach. It gives to the analyst reliable information to determine if the curves have -for example- the same mean._

### Good vs. bad variable


```r
plotar(data=heart_disease, str=c('resting_blood_pressure', 'max_heart_rate'),  str_target="has_heart_disease", plot_type = "histdens")
```

<img src="figure/variable_importance2-1.png" title="plot of chunk variable_importance2" alt="plot of chunk variable_importance2" width="400px" /><img src="figure/variable_importance2-2.png" title="plot of chunk variable_importance2" alt="plot of chunk variable_importance2" width="400px" />

<br>

And the model will see the same... if the curves are quite overlapped, like it is in `resting_blood_pressure`, then it's **not a good predictor** as if they were **more spaced** -like `max_heart_rate`.

<br>


* **Key in mind this when using Histograms & BoxPlots** They are nice to see when the variable:
    + Has a good spread -not concentrated on a bunch of _3, 4..6.._ different values, **and**
    + It has not extreme outliers... _(this point can be treated with `prep_outliers` function present in this package)_
