## _What does it cover?_

This live book (`#dsLiveBook`) covers common aspects in predictive modeling:

+  A. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
+  B. **Data Preparation** 
+  C. **Selecting Best Variables**
+  D. **Scoring Data**
+  E. **Assessing Model Performance**

## Upcoming updates

More info about methodological aspects in data preparation.

## What programming language do I need?

Most of the concepts are independent from the language, the focus is on general concepts. But when technical example is required it is done in <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org">R language</a>, using the `funModeling` package which you can install by doing: `install.packages("funModeling")`

<br>

## Book Focus

* **Stimulate intuition** behind concepts: The explanation of how to interpret results brings a deeper understanding of **what is being done**, boosting the freedom to use that knowledge in other situations regardless of the language.

* Regarding technical aspects.... model creation consumes around **10%** of almost any predictive modeling project; the **Live Book** and `funModeling` will try to cover remaining 90%.
