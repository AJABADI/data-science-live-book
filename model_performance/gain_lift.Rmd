Gain and Lift Analysis
====

### What is this about?

Both metrics are extremely useful to validate the predictive model (binary outcome) quality. More info about scoring <a href="http://livebook.datascienceheroes.com/scoring/scoring.html">here</a>.

```{r ,results="hide", echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_knit$set(base.dir = "model_performance")
```

Make sure you have the latest `funModeling` version (>= 1.3).

```{r lib, results="hide"}
## Loading funModeling
suppressMessages(library(funModeling)) 
data(heart_disease)
```

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=3}
fit_glm=glm(has_heart_disease ~ age + oldpeak, data=heart_disease, family = binomial)
heart_disease$score=predict(fit_glm, newdata=heart_disease, type='response')
gain_lift(data=heart_disease,str_score='score',str_target='has_heart_disease')
```

### How to interpret it?

First, each case is ordered according to the likelihood of being the less representative class, aka, score value.

Then `Gain` column accumlates the postive class, for each 10% of rows - `Population` column.

So for first row, it can be read as:

_"The first 10 percent of the population, ordered by score, collects 20.86% of total positive cases"_

For example, if we are sending emails based on this model, and we have budget to reach only **20%** of our users, how many responses we should expect to get?  **Answer: 35.97%**

### What about not using a model?

If we **don't use a model**, and we select randomly 20%, how many users do we have to reach? Well, 20%. That is the meaning of the **dashed line**, which starts in 0% and ends in 100%. Hopefully with the predictive model we'll beat the randomness.


The **Lift** column represents the ratio, between the `Gain` and the _gain by chance_. Taking as an example the Population=20%, the model is **1.8 times better** than randomness :muscle:ðŸ’ª.

### Using the cut point :scissors:

What value of the score reaches 30% of population? 
Answer: `0.56`

The cut point allows us to segment the data.

### Comparing models

In a good model, the gain will reach the 100% "at the beginning" of the population, representing that it separates the classes.

When comparing models, a quick metric is to see if the gain at the beginning of the population (10-30%) is higher.  

As a result, the model with a higher gain at the begining will have captured more information from data.

Let's ilustrate it...

**Cumulative Gain Analysis**: Model 1 reaches the ~20% of positive cases around the 10% of population, while model 2 reaches a similar proportion approaching the 20% of population. _Model 1 is better._

**Lift analysis**: Same as before, but also it is susupicious hat not every lift number follow a decreasing pattern. May be the model is not ordering the first percentiles of population.
 Same ordering concepts as seen in <a href="http://livebook.datascienceheroes.com/selecting_best_variables/cross_plot.html">`cross_plot`</a>
