# Methodological Aspects on Model Validation
## Time Dependant

### What is this about?

Once you've built a predictive model, how sure you are it captured general patterns, and not just the seen data (overfitting)?. 

Will it perform well when it will be on production / running live?


```{r ,results="hide", echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_knit$set(base.dir = "model_performance")
```

<br>

#### What sort of data?

If it's generated along time and -let's say- every day you have new cases like _"page visits on a web page"_, or _"new patients arriving to a medical center"_, one strong validation is the **Out-Of-Time** approach.

<br>

### Out-Of-Time Validation Example

**How to?**

Imagine you are building the model on **Jan-01**,  then to build the model keep with all the data **before Oct-31**. Between these two dates, there are 2 months.

When predicting a **binary/two class variable** (or multi-class), it's quite straight-forward: with the model we built -with data <= Oct-31; we score the data on that day, and then we measure how the users/patients/persons/cases evolved during those two months.


Since the output of a binary model should be a number indicating the likelihood for each case to belong to a certain class (<a href="http://livebook.datascienceheroes.com/scoring/scoring.html" tagrget="blank">scoring chapter</a>), you test what the **model "_said_" on Oct-31 against what it really happened on "Jan-01"**.

### How about a numerical target variable?


Now the common sense and/or business needs is more present. A numerical outcome can take any value, it can increase or decrease through time, so we may consider these 2 scenarios to help us thinking what we consider success.


**Example scenario**: You are measuring certain app usage, the normal thing is as the days pass, the users use it more.


<br>

#### Case A: Convert the numerical target into categorical?


For an app user, she/he can be more active through time-measured in page views, for example-, so to do an out of time validation we would predict if she/he will visit more than the average, or more than the top 10%, or twice what he spent up to the model's creation day, etc. 


Last examples can be:

* Binary: "yes/no" above average.
* Multi-label: "low increase"/"mid increase"/"high increase"


<br>

#### Case B: Leave it numerical (linear regression)?

Examples:

* Predicting the concentration of certain substance in blood. 
* Predicting page visits
* Time series analysis


We also have in these cases the difference between: **"what was expected" vs "what it is"**.


This difference can take any number. This is the error, or residuals.

This error can be studied through so many different techniques, here's a quick example:

**Common error measurments:**Follow <a href="https://www.otexts.org/fpp/2/5">this link</a> contains information about common error analysis based on **Time Series**, but also apply to the described case (linear regression).
